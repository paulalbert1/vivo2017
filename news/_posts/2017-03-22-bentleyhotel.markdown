### Other Recommendations

If those hotels don't work for your preferences or budget, Manhattan has many options! We recommend using Google search to find a hotel nearby at a reasonable price. Hotels in the Midtown and Midtown East vicinity are ideal. This [example Google Maps search](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hotels/@40.7650151,-73.9635447,15z/data=!4m13!2m12!3m6!1sHotels!2sWeill+Cornell+Medicine,+1300+York+Ave,+New+York,+NY+10065!3s0x89c258c3e95ed745:0xbf0b940e2f06dccd!4m2!1d-73.9547899!2d40.7649911!5m4!5m2!1s2017-08-01!2i3!9i351) shows a number of hotels in the $200-350/night range.

Upon booking or checking in to hotels not in walking distance, attendees should ask the hotel concierge for a best time to take a cab in the morning. Usually the hotel will help arrange this.
