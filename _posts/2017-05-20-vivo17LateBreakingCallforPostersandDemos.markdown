### Late Breaking Call for Posters/Demo

If you missed the earlier deadline, you have until June 12 to submit your poster or demo abstract. The poster/demo session lets you share your work in an informal, relaxed setting and chat with individual community members.

Proposals for posters and demos should be maximum of 500 words. Attendees will view and discuss your work during the poster/demo reception.
Demos will be held during the poster session.  The person presenting the demo should provide the equipment (typically a laptop).
Please indicate in your submission whether you are proposing a poster or a demo. Posters will be limited to 35 inches (width) x 35 inches (height).
Please visit the [VIVO 2017 FAQ](/faq/) page for more details.

Submissions should explore or illustrate innovative VIVO implementations, integration with other systems, or methods of tracking and displaying scholarly impact. We encourage submissions that demonstrate the use of semantic technologies to represent scholars and their work, as well as those that illustrate teams and communities collaborating across disciplines. Share your ideas and work with the VIVO community – submit your abstract by June 12!

##### [Submit your abstract](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vivo17) by June 12, 2017.
