We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed - 
but also because our team are putting together 
the final missing parts to the 8th International VIVO Conference.

This year the event will take place in the city that never sleeps - New York.

So should you also be excited? Well yes... and here's why!

* **Attendance**: we're expecting over 150 attendees
* **Topic**: more than 48 hours of the latest semantic web technologies
* **Date**: 2-4 of August
* **Venue**: Weill Cornell Medicine
* **Speakers**: we're in the process of finalising the list of speakers

More details about the conference will appear in subsequent posts.
