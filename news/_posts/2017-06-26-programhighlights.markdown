Explore our [online program](/schedule) for details on all of our scheduled content including abstracts and speaker info.

#### Keynote Talks

###### [One, No One and One Hundred Thousand: Building Networked Identities through Linked Open Data](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-801)

[Cristina Pattuelli](https://cristinapattuelli.com/) is an associate professor at the [School of Information at Pratt Institute](https://www.pratt.edu/academics/information/) in New York, US and a visiting professor at the Department of the Cultural Heritage at the University of Bologna, Italy. Her current research explores the intersection between cultural heritage and information representation and access. She is the founder and director of [Linked Jazz](https://linkedjazz.org/), a project that investigates the application of Linked Open Data technology to archival resources, and recently served as co-chair of the [LODLAM Summit 2017](http://summit2017.lodlam.net/).

Cristina's Thursday morning keynote **One, No One and One Hundred Thousand: Building Networked Identities through Linked Open Data** will explore the complexity of identities emerging from the web of links that relate one to many and the communities that help us understand our history, our culture, ourselves.

###### [Friday Morning Keynote](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-802)

[Jodi Schneider](http://jodischneider.com/jodi.html) is an assistant professor at the [School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://ischool.illinois.edu/). Jodi studies scholarly communication and social media through the lens of arguments, evidence, and persuasion. She is developing Linked Data (ontologies, metadata, Semantic Web) approaches to manage scientific evidence.

Jodi's Friday morning keynote **Viewing Universities as Landscapes of Scholarship** questions what a “Connected Graph of Scholarship” would do, that we can’t do now. The university can be seen as a collection of individuals, or as an administrative engine, but what sets a university apart is the production of knowledge and knowledgable people, through teaching, learning, and scholarly inquiry. In 2000, Michael Heaney proposed that the information landscape could be viewed 'as a contour map' with both peaks and troughs. We extend this analogy to take universities, and their faculty members, themselves as a part of this information landscape. This leads us to ask how we can apply linked data not just to a single university but to interconnect universities, and to survey the university itself as a landscape to support scholarly inquiry.

#### Invited Talks

###### [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Metadata](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-803)

[James Hendler](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~hendler/) is the Director of the [Institute for Data Exploration and Applications](http://idea.rpi.edu) and the [Tetherless World](https://tw.rpi.edu/web/TWC) Professor of Computer, Web and Cognitive Sciences at [RPI](http://rpi.edu). He also serves as a Director of the UK’s charitable [Web Science Trust](http://www.webscience.org). One of the originators of the “Semantic Web,” Hendler was a co-author with Tim Berners-Lee and Ora Lassila on the 2001 Scientific American paper [The Semantic Web](https://www.altmetric.com/explorer/outputs?q=semantic+web&scope=all&show_details=2959990).

Jim's invited talk **The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Metadata** will explore some new work in improving the relationships among the three Semantic Web models, and talk about how metadata can be used for much more than just describing resources.

###### [Knowledge Graph: Connecting Big Data Semantics](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-804)

[Ying Ding](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=35229200000) is an Associate Professor at [School of Informatics and Computing](https://www.soic.indiana.edu/), Indiana University and is currently the associate director for data science online program. She is the Changjiang Guest Professor at [Wuhan University](http://en.whu.edu.cn/) and Elsevier Guest Professor at [Tongji University China](http://www.tongji.edu.cn/english/). She is the co-editor of the [Semantic Web Synthesis](http://www.morganclaypool.com/toc/wbe.1/1/1) book series by Morgan & Claypool publisher.

Ying's invited talk **Knowledge Graph: Connecting Big Data Semantics** discusses big data challenges from the semantic perspective.

###### [Synthesizing Web Application Logic Using Structural Analysis of Ontologies](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-805)

[David Eichmann](https://www.slis.uiowa.edu/about) is Director and Associate Professor in the [School of Library and Information Science](https://www.slis.uiowa.edu/) at the University of Iowa. He also directs the [Information Science Subprogram in the Iowa Graduate Program in Informatics](https://informatics.uiowa.edu/study-opportunities/graduate-program/information-science). His current projects include [Shakeosphere](https://shakeosphere.lib.uiowa.edu/), [CTSAsearch](http://research.icts.uiowa.edu/polyglot/) and [Linked Data for Libraries](https://www.ld4l.org/) (LD4L). A recent project developed an application generator that, given an ontology and a representative triple store, constructs a JSP tag library and corresponding web application. The tag library encapsulates SPARQL interaction, allowing a developer to focus on customization of the application interface through the use of HTML-like mnemonic tags.

David's invited talk **Synthesizing Web Application Logic Using Structural Analysis of Ontologies** will address the rationale for such an approach, lessons learned and difficulties overcome relating to more-or-less complete ontologies, how a SPARQL-driven application can be nimble, and the potential for the semantic web community.

###### [Making Sense of the Confusing World of Research Information Management](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-806)

[Rebecca Bryant](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2753-3881), serves as Senior Program Officer at OCLC Research where she leads and develops areas for the [OCLC Research Library Partnership](http://www.oclc.org/research/partnership.html) and for [OCLC Research](http://www.oclc.org/research.html) related to research information management and research support services. She has also served as Director of Community at [ORCID](https://orcid.org) where she led outreach initiatives to encourage the adoption of ORCID identifiers.

Rebecca's invited talk **Making Sense of the Confusing World of Research Information Management** examines how research information management (RIM) practices have been in development in Europe, the United States, and across the globe. She will provide an update on OCLC Research investigations that seek to synthesize practices and language about institutional RIM. Her talk will also offer a view of the RIM ecosystem developed in cooperation with librarians from Research Library Partnership (http://www.oclc.org/research/partnership.html) institutions that represents global practices and demonstrates how enterprise-wide collaborations can collect, share, use, and preserve quality metadata about the institutional scholarly record.

###### [The Unified Astronomy Thesaurus: Building, Managing, and Using a Community Supported Project](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-807)

[Katie Frey](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9891-4465) is the Assistant Head and Digital Technologies Development Librarian at the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/). Katie has been leading the development of the [Unified Astronomy Thesaurus](http://astrothesaurus.org/) (UAT), a community supported linked data vocabulary for sorting, filtering, and exploring astronomical literature, data sets, images, etc. Astronomical institutions, professional associations, journal publishers, learned societies, and data repositories support the UAT as a standard astronomical terminology. These stakeholders have begun efforts to incorporate UAT into their workflows and data products, taking advantage of its linked data model to build connections between platforms.

Katie's invited talk **The Unified Astronomy Thesaurus: Building, Managing, and Using a Community Supported Project** will discuss tools for contributing and tracking suggestions that can be used by researchers and librarians, developed by the UAT's Steering Committee to solicit the detailed, comprehensive, and consistent community feedback required to keep the UAT relevant.

#### Workshops

###### [Identity Management - PCC Task Group on Identity Management](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-701)

With increasing frequency, terminology like “Identity Management” is being used in many settings including libraries where the familiar term is “Authority Control.” Librarians are interested in understanding the difference between those concepts to better align their work with the new developments and new technologies and enable the use of the authority files and identity management registries in various settings. Our task group, Program for Cooperative Cataloging Task Group on Identity Management in NACO, would like to explore and discuss with the VIVO community our common areas of interest. Come hear about some of the emerging use cases illustrating the difference, where library authority data is being utilized in new ways and join us in discussing some of the implications these developments have for the broader community. This workshop will address the new initiative to start a pilot membership program for PCC (and other) institutions with the ISNI. This new initiative is intended to help create a pathway for globally shared identifier management work in libraries, in support of not only traditional uses, like including identifiers in MARC authority work, but also forward looking projects like linked data and non-MARC library initiatives like institutional repositories, faculty profiling systems and many other use cases.

###### [How to Make Your Research Networking System (RNS) Invaluable to Your Institution](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-702)

This workshop is designed to help institutions build, leverage, and deploy the information within their RNS across the institution. The goal is to increase awareness of, engagement with and dependence on your RNS to solidify the RNS’ roles in supporting researchers. Note that the takeaways from this workshop can be applied to your RNS regardless of the underlying product, and will work for a VIVO, Profiles, “home grown,” or commercial RNS installation. The organizers intend to provide a mix of lecture, discussion, exercises, and templates to enable participants to replicate the successful engagement at UCSF, Duke and Elsevier — and avoid our mistakes.

###### [Managing Assets as Linked Data with Fedora](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-703)

Fedora is a flexible, extensible, open source repository platform for managing, preserving, and providing access to digital content. Fedora is used in a wide variety of institutions including libraries, museums, archives, and government organizations. Fedora 4 introduces native linked data capabilities and a modular architecture based on well-documented APIs and ease of integration with existing applications. Both new and existing Fedora users will be interested in learning about and experiencing Fedora features and functionality first-hand. Attendees will be given pre-configured virtual machines that include Fedora bundled with the Solr search application and a triplestore that they can install on their laptops and continue using after the workshop. These virtual machines will be used to participate in hands-on exercises that will give attendees a chance to experience Fedora by following step-by-step instructions.

###### [Promoting FAIR data principles with figshare](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-704)

There has been much talk around FAIR repositories -- making content in a repository Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Discoverable-- to help create efficiencies throughout the research workflow and allowing researchers to build on data and research that came before them. Figshare works with researchers and publishers to help bridge this gap and connect the valuable underlying data to both the article and the researcher themselves, allowing for more credit for non-traditional outputs of research to spur scientific discovery and incentivize data sharing. This workshop will be a mix of group discussion and case study presentations from Carnegie Mellon University and St Edward’s University, who will be talking through their approach to implementing figshare and the tools they have built on top of the figshare API. The half day will look at the research data management landscape, from the different approaches on the institutional level that are being taken to adjust to the various funder mandates to the ways your institution can ensure researchers comply with these funder requirements.

###### [Crosswalking Research Area Vocabularies in VIVO](http://vivoconference.org/schedule/#session-705)

Many VIVO sites use different vocabularies to indicate the research areas they are affiliated with. For example the biological sciences uses PubMed MeSH subject headings but the Physical sciences might use a controlled vocabulary from a commercial vendor like Clarivate’s Web of Science Keywords or FAST terms from the Library of Congress. This can lead to redundancy and confusion on a VIVO site that allows the end user to filter based on a vocabulary term. The same or similar terms might display multiple times. Generally an end user isn’t concerned with the originating vocabulary of the term. They just want to filter or center their experience on that term. This workshop will discuss and weigh the various options of modeling and displaying this data, in machine readable and html format, and align these options with the needs of the typical VIVO sites taking into account the governance mechanisms and uses cases for these various VIVO scenarios.

#### Posters and Demos

Our ever popular poster reception will be held Thursday evening in the **Skylight Lounge** in Weill Cornell Medicine's state-of-the-art [Belfer Research Building](http://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2014/01/weill-cornell-opens-its-transformative-belfer-research-building-empowering-scientists-to-speed-disco). This year will feature a mix of posters and interactive demos, with drinks and appetizers provided.
